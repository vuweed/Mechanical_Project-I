\section{Structure of the elevators}

    

The mechanical structure of an elevator basically consists of a driving motor, a gear box, an elevator car, a counterweight, and cables. The driving motor is used to generate motion for the gear box; meanwhile, gearbox can convert high speed, small torque to the higher torque, appropriate speed for the big main sheave. The counterweight and the car are almost the same in weight; they are hoisted by the cables and the car carries passengers.

\section{Working principle of the elevators}

As the motor is activated by the users, its rotation is transmitted to the main sheave by the gear box. By the balanced-hoisting mechanism including the counterweight and the car, the gearbox therefore can easily move the car upward or downward. When the car shifts upward the counterweight is in downward motion and vice versa. The car stops at selected floor for carrying purposes.
To reduce the noise during operating time of the elevator, the gearbox should use the worm gear transmission. Worm gear transmission has the advantage of high gear ratio, small size and self braking.
Worm gear box can use the cylindrical worm or globoidal worm. Globoidal worm gear are widely used for elevator machines thanks to its smaller dimensions in comparison to the cylindrical type with the same power rating. 
The worm gear box can be manufactured with the worm placed above or below the worm gear. Traction sheave is attached directly to the worm. The wear of the traction sheave is usually high; therefore the sheave collar should be easily disassembled for replacement. The shaft of the worm is placed on the bearing. At an end of the worm which is opposite to the motor, a hand crank is attached so that we can control the machine manually. It is also removable.
